# Altman_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project for Data Structures

This project will read in a file of a list of books and create a linked list. It is similar to the movie assignment that we did in class. I want to create several functions to order and sort the books. One method will print all books by the same author. Another will print books larger (or smaller) than a user-input's page number request. I can print the entire list of books, or all books written before (or after) a user-input's year. I could also provide the user an option to rate the books. When the program runs, an options menu will appear so that the user can choose what method will be used. These are a few ideas I have about the methods of sorting and searching the linked list. I will add more. I also want to see if maybe using a tree might be more effective in this situation. That will be an interesting question to explore. Ultimately, my project will utilize many searching and sorting algorithms. The book files I will use will be created by me and will include title, author, year of publication, number of pages, and previous user ranks. I might add more later.
